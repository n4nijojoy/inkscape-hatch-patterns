# Inkscape Hatch Patterns

This is a mirror of HenJan van der Pol's excellent [Patterns for Mechanical Drawings in Inkscape.](https://inkscape.org/~henkjan_nl/%E2%98%85patterns-for-mechanical-drawings-in-inkscape). The original ZIP package was missing the Defs.txt that you can generate by running the python script.

All credit for this goes to [HenkJan van der Pol](https://inkscape.org/~henkjan_nl/) for this very helpful pattern library.

## How to use

### Single Pattern Usage
- Read HenkJan van der Pol's instructions on how to manually copy patterns via copying and pasting object properties.

### Add to pattern fill dropdown
- Copy the content of Defs.txt inside the <defs> tag of Inkscape's built in patterns.svg file. For instance on MacOSX, this file might be located here: ```/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/share/inkscape/patterns/patterns.svg```. It may be in a different location depending on how your OS.

After doing this, the patterns will be available from the pattern fill dropdown upon restarting.
